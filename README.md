<h1>Hi, I'm Dan! Welcome to my Github. On here you can find some of the projects I've worked on both professionally and in my free time. I am an IT and controls engineering professional with a variety of experience in different industries. I have a heavy interest in system integration, data management, networking and cybersecurity, particular in the industial industry.</a></h1>

<h2>Education:<h2/>
 
<b>Bachelors of Arts in Physics, Minors in Mathematics and Anthropology</b>

 - <b>Researched trans-iron elements for abundance determination in planetary nebulae. The research was conducted at the Advanced Light Source at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory using a merged-beam technqiue to     
   photoionize elements.</b>
 - <b>Researched the unfolding of Cytochrome c (Cytc) using fluoresence correlation spectroscopy. This was used to study apoptosis. </b>
 - <b>Researched and helped design a prototype water-level sensor for automated water level detection. </b>

 <b>Professional Experience</b>
  - Automated test equipment used in electrical component testing for critical hardware. The program helped reduce man power and made the test safer for the test.
  - Automated test equipment that used visual machine learning and OCR to capture the serial number off a compnent and read the resistance of the component.
  - Automated test equipment that ran a di-electric and resistance test across 10 components at once. Software also used OCR to record the serial number of the component.
  - Built a SQL database that pulled data from TIA Portal V17 and then linked the database to Microsoft PowerBI to live trend the data. Scripted a python code to automatically export the data to a .csv on a schedule.
  - Utilized NIST's Manufacturing Cybersecurity Profile to build the company's security program. 
 
<b>Certification</b>

  - <b>Google Cybersecurity Certificate</b>
  - <b>Google IT Support Certificate</b>
  - <b>Pentest for IT Professionals by LMG Security</b>

 <b>Skills</b>

 - <b>Python Programming</b>
 - <b>SQL Programming</b>
 - <b>Data Analysis</b>
 - <b>Linux</b>
 - <b>TIA Portal V17 and WinCC V7 </b>
 - <b>LabVIEW</b>
 

<h2>Controls Projects:</h2>

-<b>Writing Data from a TIA Portal Project to a SQL Server</b>
 - Repository:
 - This was used to output process data from a control system HMI to a SQL server so that it could be used to trend process data for a pilot plant.
    
-<b>Trending Plant Process Data in PowerBI</b>
 - Repository:
 - This is a continuation of the above project where the SQL Server is linked to PowerBI to allow trending of Process Data.

-<b>Automate Exporting of Process Data to .CSVs</b>
 - Repository:
 - This is the final portion of the above two projects. Now that we can trend the data, we need a way to share it with customers. A simple python program can be built to save the .csvs can set to run at automated intervals.

<h2>Cybersecurity</h2>

- <b>Creating a SIEM in Microsoft Azure and using a Honeypot to validate</b>
- <b>Building a Malware lab</b>
- <b>Proof of Concept: Malware encryption and decryption with python</b>
- <b>Building a Honeynet to track attacks</b>

<h2>General IT</h2>

- <b>Building a Helpdesk Ticket System in SharePoint with Powerautomate.</b>
- <b>Creating a Test SQL Server and Simulating Data</b>
 - Repository:
