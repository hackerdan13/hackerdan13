<h1>Hi, I'm Dan! Welcome to my Github. On here you can find some of the projects I've worked on both professionally and in my free time. I am an IT and controls engineering professional with a variety of experience in different industries.</a></h1>

<h2>Education:<h2/>
<b>Bachelors of Arts in Physics, Minors in Mathematics and Anthropology</b>
 -<b></b>Researched trans-iron elements for abundance determination in planetary nebulae. The research was conducted at the Advanced Light Source at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory using a merged-beam technqiue to     
   photoionize elements.</b>
  -<b>Researched the unfolding of Cytochrome c (Cytc) using fluoresence correlation spectroscopy. This was used to study apoptosis. 
  -Researched and helped design a prototype water-level sensor for automated water level detection. </b>
<b>Certification</b>
  -Google Cybersecurity Certificate
  -Google IT Support Certificate
  -Pentest for IT Professionals by LMG Security

<h2>Controls Projects:</h2>
-<b>Writing Data from a TIA Portal Project to a SQL Server<b>
  Repository:
  This was used to output process data from a control system HMI to a SQL server so that it could be used to trend process data for a pilot plant.
-<b>Trending Plant Process Data in PowerBI</b>
  Repository:
  This is a continuation of the above project where the SQL Server is linked to PowerBI to allow trending of Process Data.
-<b>Automate Exporting of Process Data to .csvs</b>
  Repository:
  This is the final portion of the above two projects. Now that we can trend the data, we need a way to share it with customers. A simple python program can be built to save the .csvs can set to run at automated intervals.

<h2>Cybersecurity</h2>
-<b>Creating a SIEM in Microsoft Azure and using a Honeypot to validate</b>
-<b>Building a Malware lab</b>
-<b>Proof of Concept: Malware encryption and decryption with python</b>
-<b>Building a Honeynet to track attacks</b>

<h2>General IT</h2>
-<b>Building a Helpdesk Ticket System in SharePoint with Powerautomate.</b>
